# SuperUltrawide FPS Window Resizes

These scripts are used as launchers for some of my favorite FPS shooters.
One of annoying things about going SuperUltraWide (32:9 aspect ratio), is that
some of the competitive first person shooters (FPS) do not support aspect 
ratios wider that 16:9. These scripts aim to make it easier to launch these 
games in "borderless" window in the center of the screen. 

These launchers are created using [autoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) 
scripting language.

## Getting Started

1. First you will need to clone this repository on your local machine.

2. To run these launchers/scripts you will need to download AutoIT from 
[their website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). 

3. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned this repository.

4. Double click on the script you would like to run.
