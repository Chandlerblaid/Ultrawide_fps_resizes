# SuperUltrawide FPS Window Resizes

These scripts are used as launchers for some of my favorite FPS shooters.
One of annoying things about going SuperUltraWide (32:9 aspect ratio), is that
some of the competitive first person shooters (FPS) do not support aspect 
ratios wider that 16:9. These scripts aim to make it easier to launch these 
games in "borderless" window in the center of the screen. 

These launchers are created using [autoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) 
scripting language.
